# FTB-Normals-Renewed-1.12
This work is a fork of Vanilla Normals Renewed by Poudingue.
A shaders compatible minecraft texturepack, based on vanilla and textures added in the FTB modpack but with normals and proper glossiness informations.
This version (renewed) is made for PBR, but still a WORK IN PROGRESS, so you may encounter some textures with strange behavior. I will add all the textures used in FTB mods, starting with the most common used like Ultimate and Continuum pack.
I'm going to create milestones per single mod, ad adding them one by one.

/!\ THIS VERSION IS NOT COMPATIBLE FOR MINECRAFT ≥ 1.13

## Description

I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texturepacks in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So i decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

I release this texturepack to the public, because everyone should be able to enjoy it.

## Screenshots
Textures have bump mapping informations, allowing parallax occlusion mapping and normal mapping.
Smoothness informations is very important for the credibility of materials too, especially when the sun lights it at grazing angles.

Metals and smooth materials now have the correct informations to compute reflections.
SEUS renewed heavily realies on Screen Space Reflections for this, so the reflections won't be perfect if you really pay attention to it, but most of the time it does a good job.

## Installation

- Install a shader supporting normal and specular mapping. If you don't know which one, give this one a shot :

- On this page, click on «Clone or download», then «Download as ZIP»
- Type %appdata% on your start menu. (for windows, not sure for mac or linux)
- Go to the .minecraft folder
- Go into the resourcepacks folder. Create it if it doesn't exist
- Extract the file you downloaded here
- Select the right shader and resourcepack in minecraft options
- Enjoy !

## Known Bugs (on SEUS renewed 1.00)
- Double doors do not correctly take into account direction of light (for the second door)
- Same for Anvils, and other rotated textures, such as rails
- Very smooth surfaces may be too dark when not facing the sun (mainly fixed, but some problems maybe stayed)
- Parallax behaves strangely on rotated textures (rails, for example)
- If parallax self-shadow are on, 3D ores might look weird when lighted from direct sunlight (Pretty rare underground)
- ???
